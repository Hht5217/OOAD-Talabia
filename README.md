# Talabia Chess

Talabia Chess is an engaging game played by 2 players on a 7x6 board. The interactive gameplay involves clicking on the chess pieces displayed on your screen.

## Game Elements

### Pieces

The game involves several unique pieces, each with distinct movement capabilities:

- **The Point piece**: This piece can advance one or two steps forward. Once it reaches the board's end, it reverses direction.
- **The Hourglass piece**: This piece moves in an L shape, spanning three steps forward and two steps to the side in any direction.
- **The Time piece**: This piece can move diagonally across any number of squares.
- **The Plus piece**: This piece can traverse any distance horizontally or vertically.
- **The Sun piece**: This piece can move one step in any direction.

All the pieces are not allowed to skip over other pieces except for The Hourglass.

### Transformation of Pieces

Another intriguing aspect of Talabia Chess is the transformation of pieces. After every two turns (considering a turn as one move by each player), all Time pieces transform into Plus pieces, and all Plus pieces become Time pieces. This dynamic element adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.

## Game End

The game ends when one of The Sun is captured by the opponent.
